- Play the Demo on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355590/Lethal_Dose_Playtest
- A top-down action game inspired by Hotline Miami, Dishonored and Where the Wild Things Are
- Features fast paced combat, some pretty clever enemy AI and a built in level editor
- Solo development project: I'm creating everything except for the sound and music (which is handled by Marek Domaga≈Ça)
